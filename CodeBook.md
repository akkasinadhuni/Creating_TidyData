# This codebook lists the variables that can be obtained in the tidydata.txt file.
## Note: The data is separated by spaces.

**Subject** and **Activity** are the two extra columns that are incorporated into the tidy data to serve as identifiers for all the other variables.  

The only change made to the variable names from the original data is that the *mean()* and *std()* parts of the variable names have been changed into **Mean** and **Std**.  

The tidydata.txt file should have 81 columns in total i.e all the initial 79 columns from the original data along with the extra added two columns.
