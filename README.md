2) Select the mean and standard deviation features from all the available variables.
3) Rename the variables appropriately. (Replace mean() with Mean and std() with Std)
4) Extract information for the mean() and std() features of all variables for both the training and test datasets.
5) Merge the training and test datasets and label the columns from information obtained from (1)
6) Add  the subjects and activity columns to the "fulldata".
7) Average the variables data for each activity for each subject.
8) Write the data to a text file.
